/*
It occurs now and then in real life that people want to write about money, 
especially about a certain amount of money. If it comes to cheques or contracts 
for example some nations have laws that state that you should write out the
amount in words additionally to the amount in numbers to avoid fraud and 
mistakes. So if you want to transfer 745$ to someone via cheque you have to fill out 
two fields:

745.00$ (amount in numbers)
seven hundred and fourty five dollars (amount in words)
